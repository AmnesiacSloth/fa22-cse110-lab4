d. '3null' - null becomes a string
e. 4 - true maps to 1
f. 0 - false maps to 0 and null has no effect on expression
g. '3undefined' - undefined maps to string
h. NaN - cannot resolve expression with these arguments

14.
a. true - 2 casts to int 
b. false - both cast to int 
c. true - casts to 1 var type and then checks
d. false - casting does not occur
e. false - true has a value of 1
f. false - Boolean(2) resolves as true

15. == is weak comparison that performs type casting. === is strong comparison and compares both args as their initial types and values
